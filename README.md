This is a project developed for the course of Artificial Intelligence, which uses different AI algorithms to allocate groups of people to their tables at a dinner party. There is an unlimited number of tables but each table has a limited number of seats. The algorithms try to optimize the number of tables in which the people will sit. In other words, the solution (seating disposition) that uses the least amount of tables is the best solution.
